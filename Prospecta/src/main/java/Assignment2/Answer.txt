1. How will you tackle the challenge above ?
   Firstly, Import Classes Also which is needed than File class to FileReader Object and check File has or not than Scanner or Buffer class to read input.
   Than try to read Line, Than after Split (", ") store in Key Value Pair in Map Object.
   Again Try to Spilt (": ") for cell and value than after check if start with "=" than value is in
   formula form than check with "+-/*" and this way try to solve problem.
   
2. What type of errors you would you check for?

   NumberFormatException, CircularException, FileNotFoundException, Arithmetic Exception(If second cell
    Value is zero and divide expression)
    
3. How might a user break your code?

-->Split the String where there are "," 
--> Now I will create a LinkedHashMap(Because Order Maintain) to store the key-value pairs Key will be the cell
    and the value will be the value contained in the cell.
--> Again split by ": " than first store in String array and first value will be cell Number and Second will be value.

--> Again check if Value is number and than add value or if some expression than again split that value.
    Now will get all entries in the hash map in a set and Iterate over the map I will again go further and break the problem I will separate the 
    entries which the mathematical expression and value which have an integer value will be mapped in another hash map string a key and integer key 
    and remove it from the current hash map 

-->	If there some invalid than throw exception or if All goes fine than stored in that Linked HashMap Object
